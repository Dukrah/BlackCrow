// To read the current setLocalSpeed. From Adakite in IRC on freenode.net #BWAPI

1. Copy the "BW" and "Util" directories to the same directory as your
"BWAPI" include directory.
 
e.g.
include/BWAPI/
include/BWAPI.h
include/BW/
include/Util/
 
Location of "Util":
https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/tree/master/bwapi/Util/Source/Util
 
Location of "BW":
https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/tree/master/bwapi/BWAPI/Source/BW
 
2. You'll also need the storm files:
 
e.g.
include/storm.cpp
include/storm.def
include/storm.h
 
Location of "storm" files:
https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/tree/master/bwapi/Storm
 
3. Include the Offsets.h file with:
#include <BW/Offsets.h>
 
4. Example of usage:
 
BWAPI::Broodwar->setLocalSpeed(20);
int currSpeed = BW::BWDATA::GameSpeedModifiers.gameSpeedModifiers[0];
BWAPI::Broodwar->sendText("Speed: %d", currSpeed);
 
5. Done.
